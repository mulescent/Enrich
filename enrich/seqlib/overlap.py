class OverlapSeqLib(VariantSeqLib):
    """
    Class for count data from sequencing libraries with overlapping paired-end 
    reads for each variant. Creating a 
    :py:class:`~seqlib.overlap.OverlapSeqLib` requires a valid *config* object 
    with an ``'overlap'`` entry.

    Example config file for a :py:class:`OverlapSeqLib`:

    .. literalinclude:: config_examples/overlap.json

    :download:`Download this JSON file <config_examples/overlap.json>`

    The ``"fastq"`` config entry must contain two read files, with the keys 
    ``"forward"`` and ``"reverse"``. Information about how to combine these 
    reads is in the ``"overlap"`` config entry.

    The ``"overlap"`` config entry contains the following keys:

    * ``"forward start"`` --- position in the forward read where the \
        overlapping region begins
    * ``"reverse start"`` --- position in the reverse read where the \
        overlapping region begins (before being reverse-complemented)
    * ``"length"`` --- number of bases in the overlapping region
    * ``"max mismatches"`` --- maximum number of mismatches tolerated in the \
        overlapping region before discarding the read
    * ``"overlap only"`` --- whether to trim the merged read to contain only \
        the overlapping region (optional, defaults to ``False``)

    Here is a schematic of the case in the above JSON example::

        forward ---> 1   
                     CGACGCAAGGA
                       |||||||||

                                   1 <--- reverse

    Note that the merged sequence is identical to the wild type sequence given 
    in the JSON file.
